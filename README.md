# Snake_eye

Suppose we have a pair of dice. 🎲 🎲

In dice games, "snake eyes" means rolling two 1s. Why is it called that? Because two small dots look like a pair of snake eyes. 🐍👀

It’s the lowest possible roll (1 + 1 = 2) and is seen as bad luck. 😅

Let's keep rerolling two dice until we get snake eyes.
